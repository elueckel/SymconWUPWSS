## Symcon - Wunderground PWS Sync & Forecast Module (new WU API)
Based upon the Wunderground API this module allows to

* upload weather data from a PWS (personal weather station)
* download weather data from a PWS based upon the station ID
* download a highlevel forecast
* download a detail foreast in 12h segments - max 5 days based upon geo data

# Needed things
